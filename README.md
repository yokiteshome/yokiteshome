## Hey, I’m Yordanos

A Software Engineering student who codes, learns, builds, laughs, experiments, dreams, tries again, and lives fully while doing it.

I’m not the “I only code 24/7” type.  
I love tech, but I love life, creativity, and new experiences just as much.

I build things that solve real problems, explore ideas that excite me, and learn whatever pushes me forward. Whether it’s full-stack development, mobile apps, or AI, I enjoy turning concepts into things people can actually use.

### **Who I Am Beyond the Keyboard**

- Curious by nature
- A lover of new opportunities and new experiences
- Someone who likes challenges but doesn’t chase burnout
- A person who enjoys people, ideas, and good conversations
- Always growing, always evolving

Tech is part of my world, not my entire identity.

---

### **What I Build With**

I pick tools based on what a project _needs_, not what’s popular.

Some tools I vibe with:

- **React**
- **Flutter**
- **Node.js / Express.js**
- **REST APIs**
- **Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript**
- **Git & GitHub**

I’ve worked on everything from SaaS ideas to hackathon projects to AI-backed healthcare systems.

### **What I’m Exploring Now**

- Building software that actually helps people
- Playing with AI agents for smarter apps
- Improving my full-stack foundations
- Participating in hackathons and trying new things
- Learning: because learning makes life more fun

---

### **Behind the Screen**

I enjoy:

- Challenging myself
- Creating things I can be proud of
- Working with others
- Discovering new tech communities
- And yes, relaxing, watching anime, or just being human
